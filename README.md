# MTB: A Time-Series Prediction Benchmarking Tool Tailored to Enterprise Scenarios

## Introduction

MTB is a time-series prediction benchmarking
tool tailored to enterprise scenarios. MTB establishes prediction performance evaluation standards that align with enterprise expectations, enabling a fair comparison of time-series prediction algorithms based on their performance with real enterprise traffic data.

## Quickstart

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Load Data**: MTB implements the PyTorch dataset interface, and you can load data using the following code. For more details, refer to `example.py`:
    > The data will be automatically downloaded from Google Drive on the first run, or you can manually download it: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hn4jsjJQmZMAPJV3MKMi5tL5ey_9Spq5?usp=sharing).

    ```python
    train_dataset = mt_dataset.MTDataset(features='svc1', split="train")
    val_dataset = mt_dataset.MTDataset(features='svc1', split="val")
    test_dataset = mt_dataset.MTDataset(features='svc1', split="test")
    ```
